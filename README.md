ZapposApi
=========

Zappos Api to get the list of items based on Inputs. Only one Jar file dependency is there, which is used for JSON conversion.

Other than that , the program can be run without any constraints. It takes two inputs one for the number of items and other is the

constraint on the total price. Currently, there is no GUI, all inputs are accepted via command line or the console through the Eclipse IDE.

apiSearch is the main class which need to be executed first.

Thanks for using it , please share your views on the comment section.
